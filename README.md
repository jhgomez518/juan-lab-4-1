Reflection Questions

1. How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?

    First I had to discern what the parameters would have to be. This includes knowing which parameters would be required,
    and which would be optional. As I included them, already I began to think from the user's perspective
    and considering what scenarios of improper input I would have to account for. For a seamless UX experience,
    every time an improper input was given, I made sure to return instructions to the user about
    (I) which input of their was invalid, and (II) who to re-input in a way that WOULD be valid.

2. What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?

    I am pretty sure there was a more elegant way of writing out my conditionals in a way that did not heavily rely on
    a long string of "or" statement (>2) in the way I ended up doing. For the purposes of this exercise, I was mostly
    interested in getting the right outcome more than landing on the most "eloquent" solution. Of course I will try to
    improve with time, but it was also useful/interesting to discover the natural tendencies of my reasoning
    when it comes to thinking through conditional logic.

3. How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?

    I only re-factored in the last exercise, where I had to include a new optional parameter. In this sense, we can
    say that re-factoring makes code more maintainable insofar as it accounts for more scenarios. If one were to endlessly
    expand on the groundwork of their logic WITHOUT frequently pausing to consider as many scenarios as possible, this
    would result in a lot of backtracking and extra work. It is therefore important to re-factor early and then consistently
    in order to optimize the maintainability of your code.

P.S. Forgot to commit consistently while completing assignment. Sorry about that.
